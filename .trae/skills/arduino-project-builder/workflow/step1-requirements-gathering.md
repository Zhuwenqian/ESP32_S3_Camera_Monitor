# Step 1: Requirements Gathering

Analyze user request to understand project scope and gather all necessary information.

## Key Activities

- **User Intent Analysis:** Understand the project goal (what should it do?)
- **Hardware Inventory:** Identify required sensors, actuators, and communication modules
- **Board Selection:** Determine appropriate Arduino board (UNO, ESP32, or Raspberry Pi Pico)
- **Constraint Assessment:** Evaluate power source, memory limits, and real-time requirements

## Questions to Ask

- What is the primary function of the project?
- What sensors or actuators are needed?
- What is the target board (UNO/ESP32/Pico)?
- Are there power constraints (battery vs. wall power)?
- What data output is required (Serial, SD card, WiFi)?
- Are there size or enclosure requirements?

## Deliverables

- Clear project requirements document
- Hardware component list
- Board selection justification
- Constraint specifications
